				<h3>Welcome to Chili Pili</h3>
				<p>We are a group of motivated individuals who are passionate about bettering the lives of children of
					today. We find the schooling woefully inadequate to meet the needs of the coming generation. We aim to
					make education fun and about building intelligence, not just dumping of information.</p>

		<h3 >The Background</h3>
		<p>We are primarily a research and training company focusing on the field of early-stage education. Our team of
			experts has created and tested learning methodologies that enable a child to absorb concepts and learn faster.
			We offer online courses for parents on these methodologies which will help them teach their child the basics of
			language and maths through simple steps making the entire learning process immersive and fun for both parent and
			child.</p>
		<p>We understand that learning is not about what you teach, or how much you teach but it is about how you teach. How
			you teach makes all the difference in the quality of learning of a child. How you teach is not just about
			standardized methodology like CBSE or ICSE, nor is it about non-conventional methods like Montessori or Waldorf
			or Multiple Intelligence or learning apps . How you teach â€“ very simply is about the teacher and how they
			interact with the learner, engaging their mind and attention. We work on a continuous basis with our teachers,
			giving them the knowledge, tools, materials, and processes to help them become more capable teachers and better
			human beings, which in turn will help our children become better human beings and more capable individuals. Our
			principles are straightforward, the child learns holistically, develops all round into a better human being
			while being as involved and self-driven in the process as possible.</p>
