            <p>Every two weeks, we send an individualized report of what your child has been doing at school. If you so desire, you can go through this along with your child. We have a special section in that report, which we call Engage@home – It’s NOT home work. It is the time you can get to spend with your child in a way that is interactive and yet reiterates what happens in school. There is also no expectation from the school that you do so either … we will take care in any case. In fact, we recommend you not to try too hard to drill something into the child, as it can be counter productive ! and is against our approach.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, we have two extensive PTM (Parent Teacher Meeting) sessions in a year, where each parent gets to talk to all the teachers in the school.</p>
            <p>As a parent, is there something special you would like to share or show to the small children? Be it a musical instrument, paper origami, a story (and maybe in your language) – we welcome that ! … We host special events every now and then. Drop in a note and you are welcome.</p>
