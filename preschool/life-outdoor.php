        Outdoor learning begins here. We trust the outdoor play enables the children to enjoy the surroundings and they learn to seek out exercise, fresh air and activity. We also believe this type of play develops a disposition for the outdoors, for physical activity and care for our mother nature. For physical activities, we have installed bar games such as jumpers, climbers, balancing bars and funky-monkey bars which the children love to explore. We also have different sliders and swings.

        First play time of the day is guided where the children learn to do simple exercises, run around the ground, play games, sing rhymes and dance. All others are free play. Our playground lay amidst a bunch of trees and some children engage themselves in collecting, leaves, stones, seeds and mud and they discover the joy of getting their hands dirty. Few kids are very thrilled to crawl inside the mud cave and climb up on the mud hill which we have built at Chilli Pilli.
