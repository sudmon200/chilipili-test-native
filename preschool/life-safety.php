        While normal play and bruises are and should be part of daily life of every growing child, we take particular care that there are no serious injuries. Some of the measures we have done are –</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="font3">Mandatory safety training for all staff. We have certified professionals come and give safety training on various safety aspects – like injuries, head injuries, fractures, insect and snake bites, swooning, cuts and bruises, CPR etc.</li>
            <li class="font3">The whole staircase is padded. Children actually love moving between classes and breaks. We do want children to become independent as early as possible. To make it safe, we have worked on multiple designs and come up with our own solution, where every staircase and edge is padded with 1-inch thick rubber. These are further layered with anti-skid matting, so the chance of slipping is reduced. These are colour coded as well, so the staircase end is clearly visible. Plus railings at all levels to ensure little children also have something to catch. The upper part is netted, so children do not climb the staircase railings. To our knowledge, this level of precaution has not been taken anywhere else.</li>
            <li class="font3">We use RO water purifier for our water.</li>
        </ul>
