            <p>Some of the practical learning activites covered in classroom is being showcased here. The children are actually taught the importance of signal light and following traffic rules. They also realise the consequence of not following traffic rules. This actual simulation leaves a good impact on children. Practical simple science experiments are conducted in class to instill the scientific bent of mind. To give the practical experience of interacting with the shop keeper and to give them the pleasure of independent shopping we try to make a mock vegetable market where in the children take roles and become vendors themselves and customers as well. So a Community helper shops are set up where in the child lives the experince of being the community helper he / she wanted to be.</p>
