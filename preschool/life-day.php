        At Chili Pili children begin to trickle in around 8:20 AM and the flow continues till 8:45 AM. During this time, children walk into the toy corner. This play/settling time helps the children to meet/ greet each other, chit chat and have fun with friends while also playing. Around 8:45 AM the children go to their respective classes and the class starts with a prayer and a circle time. During circle time kids are encouraged to share any detail starting from what they ate or how they feel today etc., The class continues till 9:25 AM.
      From 9:25 AM to 9:45 AM children go out to sports activities. They are engaged in activities such as simple exercises, running around the ground, singing and dancing. By the end of these activities, they are ready to refill their reservoirs and our Thindi (Snacks) time starts here. Kids sit in a circle and helped wherever required by our facilitators to finish their food. Children are urged not to waste their food. They get around 20 to 25 minutes to finish their food.
