        <p class="font3">We do have a detailed assessment plan, where progress is sequentially tracked. This is to ensure no child misses out on learning. The assessment is done informally and is not meant so much as to assess the child, but to assist the teacher in knowing how well her engagement is getting across. The child or parent are not told about specifics so that this does not create unnecessary stress.

Academically speaking, we started out by wanting to roughly maintain the expectation that is being set by the pre-schools, so that the child is able to integrate smoothly into any class in any school. What we have found, is due to our unique phonics methodology, children read and write way better than other schoolsâ€¦because of our focus on conceptual learning, their mathematics (or pre-mathematics) is stronger. Because of our encouragement for local language as well as letting children converse in the language of their choice, their spoken English is a little behind other schools. Kannada is much better and so is their reading and writing in Kannada as well.

We have daily sports, where we cover in a light way running, climbing, bars (for hand strength) and some games. Mostly children enjoy doing it and we go with the flow. This way children are active, cover basic moments, agility, strength building, stamina in an age-appropriate way.
